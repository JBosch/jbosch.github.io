I graduated from Universitat de Girona in a degree in Industrial Engineering in 2012. I coursed my final degree project in the framework of an Erasmus Programme at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The project consisted in the integration of different simulated underwater sensors in a single simulation framework. As a result of this work I was offered the possibility to work there for a year, that allowed me to join the Heriot-Watt team in the TRIDENT FP7 project and take part in 2012 SAUC-e competition. Once again in Girona, I started the Masters in Information Technologies and  automation in UdG and I joined CIRS, where I have carried out my master's thesis in omnidirectional 
underwater camera calibration and I will realize my PhD studies under the direction of Drs. Nuno 
Gracias and Pere Ridao, studying the possibilities that the integration of an omnidirectional optical 
sensor with underwater robots can offer.

About my personal side, I'm a sports lover, mainly running and mountain biking, that allow me to enjoy the magnificent landscapes of Vilademuls and El Pla de l'Estany. I'm always happy to discuss about football: I'm a truly Barcelona supporter.
